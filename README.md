Project Overview
The Whisper model is a powerful deep learning-based ASR system designed by OpenAI. While Whisper is trained on a wide range of languages and accents, fine-tuning the model on specific datasets can lead to significant improvements for specialized use cases, such as domain-specific vocabulary or noisy environments.

This repository provides the necessary scripts and instructions to fine-tune the Whisper model on your own dataset and evaluate its performance.

How to Run
Fine-Tuning the Model
To fine-tune the Whisper model, follow the instructions below:

Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the correct format (WAV audio files and corresponding transcriptions).

Modify the data_processing.py script to load your dataset and preprocess it.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/training.py
The model will save checkpoints in the outputs/models/ directory.

Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the fine-tuned model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/evaluation.py
This will generate evaluation metrics, such as word error rate (WER), and provide insights into how well the fine-tuned model performs on your test dataset.
